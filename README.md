REACT MEMORY GAME
A REACT APPLICATION BUILT USING JAVASCRIPT, HTML AND CSS
Access
This project is hosted on heroku and can be accessed from https://memory-card1.herokuapp.com/
MOTIVATION
This project contains my learning of usestate in react and how using the index of an item can allow users to select an item on the page without the identitiy of the item being removed.
FEATURES
This app allows users to select two cards and if they match the cards turn green and if not a match they turn red and flip back.
At the beginning users are shown the cards so they can memorize before they are flipped.
Challenges
Everytime the user refreshes the page the cards are shuffled so in order to allow the browser to know what card is being clicked I used the index of the card to allow proper functionality otherwise the game would not work
